PyQt6 licensing note:
PyQt6 is GPL-3.0/commercial. If you distribute binaries that include PyQt6, you must
comply with GPL-3. Consider one of:
  (A) Keep PyQt6 and distribute under GPL-3 terms (your repo can stay Apache, but the
      shipped binary must satisfy GPL-3 obligations), or
  (B) Switch to PySide6 (LGPL-3) to keep permissive distribution under Apache-2.0, or
  (C) Obtain a commercial PyQt license.
Consult counsel for the appropriate path.
