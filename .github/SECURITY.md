# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We currently support the latest tagged release only (e.g., `v0.1.x`). Older tags receive no security fixes.


## Coordinated Disclosure
- We will investigate, develop a fix, and publish an advisory in the repository Releases page.
- We prefer **90-day** coordinated disclosure by default; weâ€™ll work with you on timelines if needed.

## Dependencies
This project uses standard Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, PyQt/PySide).  
We periodically run `pip-audit` and ship the report in release artifacts when applicable.
